Welcome to Project Channel 1!
*to be involved in a project, join #project-2 channel on slack*

Let’s start with a quiz!
We’re going to be building a Javascript Quiz web application. This will be a simple app that uses HMTL, CSS and JS and it should have the following functionality:
It will be a multiple choice quiz that has radio buttons and it keeps track of the user’s score
A minimum number of 5 questions should be added however you can add as much as you want
When the quiz is complete. Sum up the user’s score and display the answer to them.
Store your questions in an array. Each question, along with its choices and correct answer.
```javascript
var allQuestions = [{question: "Who is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom?", choices: ["David Cameron", "Gordon Brown", "Winston Churchill", "Tony Blair"], correctAnswer:0}];
```
Dynamically (with document.getElementById or jQuery) remove the current question and add the next question, when the user clicks the “Next” button. The Next button will be the only button to navigate this version of the quiz.


*Ask a mentor for help if you feel stuck, or you don’t know where to start.
Check a table in the end of the file to see who is a mentor now.*
